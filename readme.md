# InstaLike


Run script with: 
```javascript
node index.js --username user1 --password pass --target userToLikeTheImagesOf --speed 40
```
or 
```javascript
npm start -- --username user1 --password pass --target userToLikeTheImagesOf --speed 40
```

The Script runs till it finds an already liked image. For now..

If you are on MacOs and you want this script run on every start.. adjust the plist file
and put it in /Library/LaunchAgents/instalike.plist the owner of it must be root.
